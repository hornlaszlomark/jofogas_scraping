# :house_with_garden: Web scraping project of jofogas.hu :house:

As part of my application, I'd like to present some of my skills to the recruiter(s) of **Casafari** in a showcase project. 

### Goal:
- Scraping of real estates for sale in Budapest on https://ingatlan.jofogas.hu/

### Challenges:
- creating the scraping logic
- dealing with missing data and outliers

### Python libraries:
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- pandas



Selenium is slower compared to the ones I used for this project. I'm going replicate the whole thing in Scrapy later.

TODO:
- [ ] scraping the amount of pictures are uploaded
- [ ] scraping the real estate agency's name and contact
- [ ] async/await introduction for parallel processing (reducing wait time)
- [ ] production ready implementation
